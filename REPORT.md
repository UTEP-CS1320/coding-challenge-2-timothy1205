### CODING CHALLENGE #2: REPORT

I used a total of 6 if statements, 5 of which are used in an if-else-if chain. The initial if statement is a check to see if the Systolic Pressure is less than the Diastolic Pressure as if this is ever true, we should simply print "ERROR" and end the program. The next 5 if statements are used for the 5 categories. I opted to order them backwards as I felt it made more sense. The fact that the last 3 statements are OR statements also made the logic easier for me to work with, as I simply checked the pressures in descending order so I wouldn't need to use unnecessarily conditions. Each condition compares the systolic pressure and diastolic pressure to correspond to the information included in the README. (For the Hypertensive Crysis category, I left it as an OR statement since it covers the possible AND case.)

I believe one if statement for each possible case is the absolute minimum possible, so assuming I didn't miss an edge while testing my code, I believe this is the smallest amount of if statements required for this to function.
